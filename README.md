## For Reviewer

Welcome to my task manager project. Before starting, I apologize if some things are missing or inconsistent with task.pdf since there were inconsistencies there between frontend and backend feautures.

Link to [live server](http://64.226.121.96/login/). (Google and Github signin are disabled on live server since I dont have a domain).

For any questions, you can reach me at samir.sagi@gmail.com.

Thank you for your time and patience!
